PHP REST Client
------------
This sample provides a library to interface with the REST API of the JasperReports Server


Requirements
------------
To use the sample, you will need:
  * Web server running PHP 5.3 or greater
  * The PEAR package manager (http://pear.php.net)
  * XML_Serializer PEAR package (http://pear.php.net/manual/en/package.xml.xml-serializer.php)
  * PHPUnit PEAR package (if you intend on running the unit tests)
  
See the php documentation for inforation about installing pear packages.


Installation
------------
Make sure you have a web-server and PHP processor installed. For simplicity it is suggested to run
Z-WAMP (http://zwamp.sourceforge.net/). However for a more scalable solution Apache and PHP can be installed and
configured manually.

Configure 'php.ini' so that the value for 'Date.timezone' matches your location. A list of accepted values
can be found on the PHP website. The values correlate with the universally unix accepted timezone names.
Example: Date.timezone = "America/Los_Angeles"

Install PEAR and use it to install the XML_Serializer package `pear install -f XML_Serializer`


Security Notice
------------
This package uses BASIC authentication to identify with the server. Usernames and passwords are sent in clear text
and should only be done over a connection that is trusted between the client and the server.


PHPUnits
------------
The PHPUnits are provided as an example of how to make requests using this wrapper. They can be valuable not only for testing the integrity
of the package, but also for learning how the functions are used within the package.

When executing the PHPUnit program, you can point to the phpunit/ directory in the package folder. This will run all the tests. You can also 
provide a path to a single test file to run only the tests in that file.

The PHPUnits are configurable to your specific environment by editing the test.properties file located in the phpunit/ folder of this package.

In order to run PHP Units you will need to install and configure the package. Follow refer to: http://www.phpunit.de/manual/3.0/en/installation.html
for a better understanding of how to install this package.

Before running the tests, it is suggested you disable E_STRICT error reporting in the php.ini file. This can be done by editing the error_reporting variable from "E_ALL | E_STRICT" to just
"E_ALL" unfortunately there are deprecation errors in the XML_Serializer dependency which causes tests to fail, this adjustment will fix that.


Visual PHP Units
------------
Included in the vpu/ folder is a Visual PHPUnit tool built by Nick Sinopoli. Using this tool you can see visual representations of the PHPUnit tests when they are ran.

In order to use this package, you must edit the file vpu/app/config/bootstrap.php and configure the required variables. 

You must set pear_path to point to the folder of your PEAR installation, as well as the test_directory to point to where the PHPUnit tests are. If you leave the package folder structure
in place you will not have to edit the test_directory variable.

You also must have mod_rewrite enabled on your server if it is Apache, or if you are using a different web server, you will need to configure redirects as explained on the
VisualPHPUnit project page: https://github.com/NSinopoli/VisualPHPUnit

This tool is accesible through a web-browser
