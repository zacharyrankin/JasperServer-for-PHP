Instalation Instructions
------------------------

Quick Overview
* Uncompress this folder into a path accessible to your Webserver
* Set the Webserver Document Root: "./web_root"
* Add "./resources/" to the include path of your PHP.ini
* Modify "./resources/config.php" to match your JS and App instalation paths and URLs

Instalation How-To:

Assuming that you have unzipped the file in:

<myfolder>/php-sample-app/

And inside that folder you have 2 folders:
- ./resources
- ./web-root

1) in httpd.com (apache configuration file) add this:
---
# Alias for PHP APP demo
Alias /myphpapp "<myfolder>\php-sample-app\web_root\"
<Directory "<myfolder>\php-sample-app\web_root\">
    Options Indexes  FollowSymLinks MultiViews ExecCGI
    AllowOverride All
    Order allow,deny
    Allow from all
</Directory>
---

2) Modify the .htaccess file in web-root
- Edit the file called htaccess-sample that is in web-root there is only one line in this file should look like this:

php_value include_path "<myfolder>\php-sample-app\resources;<myPEARinstallfolder>;."

<myPEARinstallfolder> is your path to php-pear installation folder, this may be in a different path check your php.ini file

- SAVE this file as ".htaccess" note the . (dot) at the beginning. (IMPORTANT)

3) Restart apache

4) Change the paths inside ./resources/config.php
- Line 49: define('SITE_PATH', '/Library/WebServer/Documents/JSDemo/');
- Line 72: define('JS_WS_URL', 'http://localhost:8080/jasperserver-pro/rest/');  // if needed

5) Change the path to JRS in  iframe.php
- Line 47: $iFrameServerURI = "http://localhost:8080/jasperserver-pro/";

6) go to: http://localhost/myphpapp and Voila!

The RESTclient.php file has the imput control rendering funtions and  all the meat is in:
- login.php (authentication)
- home.php (repository browser)
- viewReport.php and executeReport.php (view and execute report)
